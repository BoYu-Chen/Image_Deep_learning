Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification

# Goal
Classify 60,000 images of 10 classes through convolutional neural network (CNN).

# Key Findings
1. This project trained multi-classification CNN model on 50,000 images and tested on 10,000 images.
2. The model achieves **81.79% accuracy** on test data.
3. By analyzing the performance and training process of the first model, the second model **saves training time by 58%**, and **improves accuracy by 8.6%**.
4. There is only slight overfitting problem.
5. If more training time is given, the accuracy could be further improved, and the overfitting problem could also be reduced more.
